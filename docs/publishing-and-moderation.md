# Creator publishing and moderation

This covers [tdf-iroh-s3#17](https://github.com/arkavo-org/tdf-iroh-s3/issues/17). The decisions behind it are recorded on that issue:

- Publishing needs the Arkavo creator-publishing entitlement.
- Pushes are authenticated, not only tag writes.
- Operators can suspend creators and block content.

The settings live under `[publishing]`. The gate is **on by default**.

## Publishing

A publisher's CWT must:

- be verified against the node's key set and `[http] expected_issuer`;
- carry `aud` = `[publishing] audience` (default `arkavo`, the identity.arkavo.net passkey token);
- list `[publishing] entitlement` in `arkavo_entitlements`. The default is `https://patreon.arkavo.com/attr/arkavo-creator/value/publish`, issued by authnz-rs#91;
- name a person, not a service client (`client:*`);
- name a subject that is not suspended.

### 1. Open a publish session for the iroh endpoint that will push

```bash
curl -X POST https://iroh.arkavo.net/publish/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <cwt>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"endpointId":"<this device's iroh endpoint id>"}'
# 201 {"endpointId":"…","subject":"<sub>","expiresAt":<unix>}
```

The session lasts `[publishing] session_ttl_secs` (default 900).

- The node accepts iroh pushes only from an endpoint with a live session, and only while its subject is not suspended.
- Any other push is refused with a permission error, and nothing is stored.
- The pusher's subject is recorded at `moderation/publishers/<hash>`.
- Sessions are held in memory on the node. After a restart, open a new one.

### 2. Point the catalog tag at the new catalog

Use `PUT /tags/catalog/<sub>` (see the README). It now also requires the entitlement, an unsuspended subject, and a hash that is not blocked.

### When a membership lapses

When the membership lapses, the entitlement disappears from new tokens (authnz-rs#91). New sessions and tag writes are then refused. Published content stays up until a moderator blocks it.

### Creator app impact

The Creator app must open a session before each push. Until it does, pushes to a gated node are refused. Set `required = false` only on development nodes.

## Moderation (operators)

Operators authenticate with a service CWT:

- `sub = client:<id>`;
- role `service-account`;
- `aud` containing `<id>`;
- `<id>` listed in `[publishing] operator_client_ids`.

The authnz-rs `client_credentials` grant mints such tokens. If the list is empty, these routes answer 503.

| Route | Effect |
|---|---|
| `PUT /moderation/suspensions/{subject}` `{"reason","reportId"?,"hideCatalog"?}` | Refuses the subject's sessions, pushes and tag writes. With `hideCatalog`, `GET /tags/catalog/{subject}` returns 404. |
| `DELETE /moderation/suspensions/{subject}` | Lifts the suspension. |
| `PUT /moderation/blocks/{hash}` `{"reason","reportId"?}` | Takedown: iroh fetches of the hash are refused, it is left out of `/catalog/{group}` listings, no tag may point at it, and a tag already pointing at it returns 404. |
| `DELETE /moderation/blocks/{hash}` | Lifts the block. |
| `GET /moderation/suspensions`, `GET /moderation/blocks` | Active records. |

```bash
curl -X PUT https://iroh.arkavo.net/moderation/blocks/<hash> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <service cwt>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"hate speech","reportId":"6f9619ff-8b86-d011-b42d-00c04fc964ff"}'
```

Subjects compare in canonical form: `arkavo:<id>` and a bare `<id>` are the same account.

### Audit

Each suspension or block is stored as a JSON object under `moderation/suspensions/<subject>` or `moderation/blocks/<hash>`. The object records who set it, when, why and the report ID.

- Lifting one sets `liftedBy` and `liftedAt` instead of deleting it, so the object is the audit trail.
- Each change is also logged with an `audit` field.

### Propagation

- Records are read before the node starts, and **startup fails if they cannot be read**.
- They are then re-read every `moderation_refresh_secs` (default 30), so changes made through another node, or directly in S3, apply without a redeploy.
- A failed refresh keeps the last view, so a storage error never lifts a suspension.

### Not included

- **Deleting stored bytes.** A block stops distribution, but it does not remove the blob from the node's store or from S3.
- **Resolving a report's `contentId` to hashes.** That waits for the frozen catalog schema, so a takedown names payload hashes.
- **Consuming arkavo-rs's NATS `moderation.actions.*` events.** That NATS is not reachable from EC2. arkavo-rs or a moderator calls this API.

## Configuration

```toml
[publishing]
required = true                    # false: open pushes and tag writes (development only)
entitlement = "https://patreon.arkavo.com/attr/arkavo-creator/value/publish"
audience = "arkavo"                # "" disables the audience check
session_ttl_secs = 900
operator_client_ids = ["moderation"]
moderation_refresh_secs = 30
```

The node's IAM role needs `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject` and `s3:ListBucket` on `<prefix>moderation/*`.
